  Entrevoisins is a very user-friendly Android app allowing you to list people living in your area and learn more about their interests.
  You can also add those neighbours to favorite and even generate new people to your list! By clicking on the user, you can also navigate to their profile page, including information such as name, profile picture, location, ‘about me’ section and social media account.
  More features will be soon available, so stay tuned.
